Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 was passed in 2008 requiring the use of Positive Train Control (PTC). The technology 
was reported to be installed on all required railways by the end of 2020. Has there been a statistically significant 
decrease in the number of accidents related to human error? Has this legislation had any other interesting effects on the 
number of incidents since 2020?

Plan: Compare number/severity of accidents from 2006-2008 to post 2021-2022. Let algorithm find significant attributes.


What factors of incidents drive the probability for high casualties? Are there specific qualities of activity that drive 
high casualty accidents? Are there any correlations that may suggest how to improve these areas? What might be suggested 
in the form of regulation to decrease the number of high casualty events?
Plan: Try to find attributes that lead to accidents with high casualities (rare). 


Does the design of the highway-rail intersection significantly affect the probability of collision?
